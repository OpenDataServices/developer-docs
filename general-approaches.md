# General approaches to software development

We are influenced by:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt
* 12 factor web apps - http://12factor.net/
* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and similarly having a SSOT (Single Source of Truth)

## Agile development

We practice (small-a) agile software development, drawing on a range of techniques and practices. Each of our projects is different - some will require a full Scrum process, others only a very lightweight set of practices to keep us focussed. Tools that we use include:
* Scrum ceremonies
* Kanban boards
* Standup meetings

We hold regular retrospectives to review our work and our use of agile techniques and to look for ways in which we can improve.

# User-centric design

We recognise that all of our software and standards will be used by humans, and therefore we regularly engage in user research to discover the needs of those who will use the software that we're producing. The way in which we use this knowledge will vary depending on the project, but we will often refer back to the user stories that we're attempting to satisfy during development.
