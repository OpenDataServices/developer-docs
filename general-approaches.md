# General approaches to software development

We are influenced by:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt
* 12 factor web apps - http://12factor.net/
* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and similarly having a SSOT (Single Source of Truth)

## Other possibilities / aspirations:

### Agile 

We don't currently do this fully, because of our small team size 
amongst other reasons.
