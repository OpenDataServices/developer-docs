Non-Sprint Work Planning & Sprint Co-ordination
===============================================

Not a snappy title, but a relatively straightforward meeting. The purpose is to review the non-sprint work board and current sprint boards at the same time to establish priorities, expected capacity and allocation of tasks for the following week.


Who should attend?
------------------

All developers should attend


Agenda
------

- Open the non-sprint board
- "Is there anything that we've done since the last team meeting? If so, it should be in Done"
- "Is there anything that we're currently working on that's not either In Progress or on the sprint board?"
- Briefly summarise the status of each issue In Progress, request feedback or review, ask for help
- "Is there anything in the Backlog that should be higher priority than it is? For example, due date in the next month, or something you know is important"
- "Is there anything in Proposal that we need to move to the Backlog?"
- If the Backlog is under the WIP limit, what from Proposal is a good candidate for moving across?

Typically, this meeting is scheduled for 1h but takes less. We often take time after this meeting for a couple of people to discuss an issue that requires some attention.
