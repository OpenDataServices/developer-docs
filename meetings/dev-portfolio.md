Dev Portfolio
=============

The Dev Portfolio call is an opportunity for a couple of team members to review all of the various 'moving parts' of the dev team's work and look ahead to anything coming up that requires preparation for, or that requires following up from. It is designed to relieve the whole team of the cognitive burden of having to think about all the things the team does.


Who should attend?
------------------

So far, this has been just Rob and Ben. Others are welcome, but the purpose of the meeting is to avoid the whole team having to be involved in the team's coordination.


Agenda
------

Partipants review the [Dev Portfolio](https://opendataservices.plan.io/projects/portfolio/agile/board) board right-to-left. Items in the Current Sprint column reflect the current sprint's work, the In Progress column reflects the work that the team is currently considering in some way (e.g. future sprints, recent sprints, non-sprint work), and the Pipeline column reflects work that may be realised in the future.
