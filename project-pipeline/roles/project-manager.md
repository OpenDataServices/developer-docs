# Project Manager (WIP)

This outlines what kind of tasks a project manager is likely to perform at different stages of a project.

## Before the contract is signed

* No involvement - in general, around to consult for PO
  
  OR
* Involved in formative meetings, contract negotiations, etc to gain high level overview of the project and consider breakdown, timescales etc

## Contract signed, before work starts / between work periods

* Set up delivery process e.g. Trello board + agreed development process
* Ensure time is scheduled
* Dev scheduler!
* plan.io project
* notes on useful settings / defaults
* Harvest / Forecast
* notes on what to do!
* harvest budget from contract - choose an hours/day 
* forecast -> import from harvest
* In forecast, remember people’s 50% thing
* Xero, ReceiptBank, Income + cost forecast
* Xero - Accounting -> advanced -> add another option
* Schedule kick-off calls, standups, work periods (mostly internal)
* Provide the tools for PO to record + visualise pre-development work
* Identifying + visualising pre-dev work
* Recording input from people who helped define the work, for future development
* Identifying dependencies across disciplines

## During work periods

* Facilitating meetings
* Making sure that they happen
* Possibly attending + running them, if helpful e.g. retros
* maybe standups - to review impediments
* Scribing on Trello
* Ensuring that the board reflects reality	
* Blocked things
* Following up on raised impediments blockers
* Feedback on aims vs reality
* Reflection
* Reminders of other objectives
* Reviewing timetracking + encouraging * updating
* 
## After work periods

* Invoicing
* Work with PO, client, team to assess * work that hasn’t been done
* Work with PO to prepare client reporting
* Organise + run retros
* Prepare for next sprint 


Setup tasks
* Knowledge Management
    * Start a new board
    * Populate with things that you’ve already got
        * emails
        * plan.io ticket links
        * GH issue links 
        * doc links
        * highlighted comments from docs
* Timetracking 
    * Harvest
        * Set up the client, project, etc
        * You may need to back-fill some biz dev time
    * Scheduling through Forecast
        * Fill out when you expect the work to happen
    * (maybe) scheduling through dev spreadsheet
* Work tracking
    * Start a new board
    * If a new project, populate with high-level objectives
        * Look around to work out where these are:
            * Contract (including appendices)
            * Proposals 	
            * Other documentation shared by the client
    * Then, add in any initial identified tasks
        * Don’t just copy the contract objectives as these are unlikely to be discrete work items
        * But, do add in any specific tasks that you can see need to be done
    * If an existing project, populate to match the state of reality
        * Then, adjust - maybe you want to drop some work?
        * As part of the lead-in to the project, make sure you’re aware of how you’re going to end it
            * Same for each sprint - testing data, sign-off, time for rework, etc
    * Communication
        * Establish how the client will be involved in the work
    * Starting work
        * kick-off call
            * Objectives
