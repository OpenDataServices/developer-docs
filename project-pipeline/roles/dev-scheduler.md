# Dev Scheduler

The primary role of the dev scheduler is to maintain the [dev focus spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1re9ylCBodfW9UhGbMg0KminIeKg439WxRCNL7jf02IE/edit#gid=1534895023).

This informs the developers of the projects they will be involved with on a week by week basis. The spreadsheet is currently updated on a ad-hoc basis. This involves Project Stewards speaking to the Dev Scheduler and specifying the capacity required over a given period.

Ideally some indication of the required capacity is established before the contract is signed to ensure that the requirements can be met.
