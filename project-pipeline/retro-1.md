# Retro Guide

We’ll split into 3 groups - Red, Green and Blue for the first 15 minutes of the call. By the end of the 15 minutes, your group needs to have agreed on 3 things to bring back to the main call; the main call can’t start until all groups have done this. 

In your group, designate a timekeeper. They need to act with an iron fist to keep you to time, but the timings here are possible! 

First, take 5 minutes (often, it helps do this in silence) for people to ‘brain dump’ cards onto the board. Please use the colour of your group, so that we can track which group did what, later. The cards are in three categories - things we want to Celebrate, things that raise Concern, and things that we found to be of Interest. The period that the retro covers is the period since the last retro, whenever that was. 

For the next 5 minutes, review each others’ cards. If any cards are unclear, ask for clarification. You probably don’t have time to talk about every card. If cards are similar, you can cluster them together. 

In the last 5 minutes, talk about what you want to take back to the main group. You don’t have time for a big conversation or to gain hard consensus, so adopt a mindset of being happy to let details drop. Once you’ve agreed on your ‘top 3’, add cards to the bottom section for your group. 

Keep a log of anything that you’ve scheduled to deal with later - it’s natural that this process will remind you of things that you want to deal with / organise another call about separately. It can also be about the thing that you bring to the main retro!

Designate a speaker for your team, as they’ll be called upon to briefly present the cards that you’ve chosen.

## Miro tips
Don’t be scared to zoom in and out a lot - make the section you’re working on fill your screen, then when you’re done, zoom out to see the big picture. It’s a big workspace
Colour matters - if there’s an example, please try to match it
Miro’s designed to encourage grouping and use of visual indicators to communicate information about things - take advantage of that!
Stick within the lines, as they’re the ‘frames’ that are used later for archiving. If they’re not big enough, use smaller post-its and zoom in further! 
You can turn off people’s cursors using the ‘sliders’ icon/menu in the top/right. Don’t forget to switch
