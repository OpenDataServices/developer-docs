# Project Kickoff

The purpose of the project kick-off meeting is to:
* Ensure that the people involved in the project all know each other, and to build relationships so that future communication is easier 
* Ensure that everyone on the project knows enough of the technical detail to be able to understand the project, their role in it, and where they need to learn more in the early stages of the work
* Ensure that everyone on the project knows enough of the purpose of the project to be able to make good decisions about the work that they’re doing, and to allow future planning meetings to focus on execution, rather than purpose. 
* Ensure that everyone on the project knows what their first task is, and broadly what’s coming afterwards. 


These calls are about developing a shared sense of purpose. It’s helpful to make a big deal out of them, and to take time over each part, so that everyone’s gained a proper understanding of what’s ahead. It’s important to make time for everyone to speak, ask questions and go over things for themselves; it’s easier to build shared understanding early than to correct misunderstanding later. For people who’ve been involved in developing the work, it should feel like they’re labouring each point; that’s a good indicator that it’s pitched at the right level for either new or returning team members. 

In general, there shouldn’t be any surprises, and people shouldn’t be forced into making difficult decisions that they would rather give more thought to. This is especially true if the meeting is happening at the start of the sprint, when there’s already time pressure on development work. However, these are working meetings, so it’s fine to use the time to carry out workshop exercises to help everyone gain a common understanding and to unpick issues together.

## Getting Started

It’s often helpful for the people in ODSC who are working on the project to give some thought before time to how the work might be structured; the effort and form of this needs to be balanced against the possibility of the early part of the call rendering the work fully or partially invalid. It’s also important to remember that people typically need to work through a process themselves to fully understand it. 

Get someone who’s looked at the work already to present any analysis that they’ve already done. This might address points like:
* Sequencing; what can happen in parallel, what’s dependent on other things being completed, and so on
* Timing; working backwards from the end of the project, what needs to be done by a certain date so that further work can be done on it? What are those dates?
* Outstanding questions; what do we know that we don’t know? Who can answer those questions? What can’t start until those questions are answered? Do we know anything about the likely outcome of those questions?
* Breakdown of high-level tasks; are there any obvious ways to break up the work? Is there an obvious starting point? 
* Measuring progress; how will we know how far through we are? If there are tasks that look similar, can we expect the first one to take longer as we work out what we’re doing? When will we start to feel the pressure of needing to complete early work?
* Roles and specialisms; who has particular knowledge or experience? Is any of this work a particularly good learning opportunity for someone wanting to learn more?

Then, go through the process of creating an initial backlog. In the interests of time and attention, it might make sense for the usual rules around Ready to be suspended, and work items placed in an interim Ready queue for refinement by the team at a later date.

Below is a sample agenda, based on our previous experience of running these.

## Sample Agenda

### 1. People

All developers, analysts, project managers, product managers, client staff and contractors should attend. Depending on the work, some of these may be able to attend for only part of the session.
Get everyone to introduce themselves, and share something - such as why they’re looking forward to this project. 

### 2. Vision
Get someone who’s been involved in defining the work to give a high-level overview of why the work is being done, and who might benefit from it. This might be the client, or a product manager. They might address points like:
* Who the client is, and what their aim is as an organisation?
* How this work fits into the wider work of the organisation?
* Who’s funding it, and why?
* Who the work is intended for?
* Any guiding principles?
* What the client will do with the work?

### 3. Project
Get someone who’s been involved in defining the work to give a high-level overview of the work that’s to be done. This might expand on what’s in the contract. They might address points like:
* What new products are we going to make?
* What new features or changes are we going to make to existing products?
* What’s the timescale for the project?
* What external pressures there might be
* What role we’re playing, if we’re working with other contractors or staff at the client organisation
* What’s core, and what’s an optional extra
* Any expectations around trade-offs, such as features vs stability

If there’s time, and it’s appropriate, activities such as Atlassian’s trade-offs play could be helpful.
