Python Versions
===============

Python2 vs Python3
------------------

All of our currently deployed or actively developed code uses Python 3. Some libraries also support Python 2.


Minor Versions
--------------

Where we support Python 2 we support only Python 2.7. 

TODO Add notes on Python 3

We test libraries against all the minor versions they support, and our application code against the version it will be deployed with.
