# Front End Development

We don't do very sophisticated frontend stuff at the moment. We tend to 
rely on popular framewors such as Bootstrap etc. T

We tend to use HTML5, plain CSS, and Javascript everywhere, and don't 
have any sort of transpilation (or for the most sort any sort of build) 
setup.

Our use of Javascript is generally fairly oldschool progressive 
enhancement (JQuery table sorters etc.).

We tend to use external Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for our 
dependencies, as it's easier, and people might have these cached. 

Our setup is not the greatest, but it is simple, and works well as 
we've not been heavily frontend focused this far.
