# Working Off-line

## Grab GitHub issues to work offline e.g.

    wget -m --no-parent  -e robots=off "https://github.com/OpenDataServices/developer-docs/issues/"

## Google Drive

With a chrome browser and the appropriate apps/settings it is possible 
to work off-line with documents, spreadsheets, etc

## Developing Off-line

GitHub issues can be grabbed (see above)

We use Content Delivery Networks quite often for style and layout (e.g.
Bootstrap), sometimes these can be apain off-line.
