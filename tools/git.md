# git

## How we use git

* Our workflow has some similarities to, but is not gitflow
* Working on feature branches, and rebasing/squashing these (rebase -i) 
to give a useful clean, usefully broken down view of history. 
(including rebasing on master rather than meging master in, if 
possible)
* Using [#issueno] rather than fixes #issueno in order to leave 
closing issues until it's been checked that they're "Done"

Also maybe:

* Committing tmp commits to tmp branches as an alternative to git stash
