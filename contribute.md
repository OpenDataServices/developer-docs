Contributing
============

We appreciate all contributions to our open source projects. 

* We're interested in user experience and feedback from using the application.
* We'd like people to fix bugs and contribute to features.
* We're interested in people using the code for their own purposes.
* We're interested in suggestions, modifications and improvements.

All our code can be found at https://github.com/opendataservices

Each project should have a specific ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` file that gives more specific information about how to contribute to that particular project.

Everything we are working on, or considering, is kept in GitHub issues. Feel free to contribute to any of these.

Bitesize issues
---------------

Getting started on someone else's software project can be daunting. So when we have an issue that we think would be a good task for someone new to the project, we mark them as  Bitesize.  

Look for issues marked with the [Bitesize](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Aopendataservices+label%3ABitesize) label if you want somewhere to start.


Expectations around merge requests and deploying
------------------------------------------------

When someone approves a pull request, they should not merge it straight away 
(unless there is a comment asking them to do that).

It is up to the person who did the work to merge it in and delete any working branches from GitHub.

If that person is unavailable and others need it, they can merge though (unless there is a comment asking them not to).

If this is an app we deploy, the code should then be deployed promptly. 
It's the person who did the works responsibility to make sure it is deployed (by doing it themselves or asking someone else to).

If this is a library we use, the person doing the work should decide if a new release is needed 
(is the code needed by a user of the library straight away?), and if so, do one immediately.
